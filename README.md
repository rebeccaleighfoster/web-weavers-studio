## Summary

Web Weavers Studio is a fullstack CRUD app that provides users with the opportunity to create and maintain a list of weaving projects. Users can track data on their personal projects along with seeing data on other's projects.

## Motivation
 
Handweaving is a craft that has been passed down by women and men in in person studios and homes for generations. As the people start aging out of the craft, the app intends tor replace some of the in person knowledge sharing by providing users with quick data on projects. Additionally, keeping track of data on personal projects can be daunting as well, so having one place to log projects will simplify notetaking.

## API Endpoints
This CRUD app has several endpoints. The get endpoints include one that returns all the weavers' information, one that returns an individual weaver's information, one that returns all the projects in the database, and one that returns all the projects that a specific weaver has logged. The post end points enable users to create an account, or add a project. The users can also update their project information with a patch endpoint and delete a project with a delete endpoint.
